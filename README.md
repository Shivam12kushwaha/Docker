### Docker is the platform designed to help developers build, share and run container applications.
### Why do we need Dockers?
### Consistency Accross Environments:
**Problem:** Applications often behave differently in developement, testing, and production environments due to variations in configurations, dependecies and infrastructure.\
**Solution:** Docker containers encapsulates all the necessary components, ensuring the application runs consistently accross all environments.
### Isolation:
**Problem:** Running multiple applications on the same host can lead to conflicts such as dependency clashes or resource contention.\
**Solution:** Docker provides isolated environments for each application, preventing interference adn ensuring stable performance.
### Scalability:
**Problem:** Scaling applications to handle increased load can be challenging, requireing manual intervention and configuration.\
**Solution:** Docker make it easy to scale applications horizontally by running multiple container instances allowing for quick and efficient scaling.\
