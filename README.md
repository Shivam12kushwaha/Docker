### Docker is the platform designed to help developers build, share and run container applications.
### Why do we need Dockers?
### Consistency Accross Environments:
**Problem:** Applications often behave differently in developement, testing, and production environments due to variations in configurations, dependecies and infrastructure.\
**Solution:** Docker containers encapsulates all the necessary components, ensuring the application runs consistently accross all environments.
### Isolation:
**Problem:** Running multiple applications on the same host can lead to conflicts such as dependency clashes or resource contention.\
**Solution:** Docker provides isolated environments for each application, preventing interference adn ensuring stable performance.
### Scalability:
**Problem:** Scaling applications to handle increased load can be challenging, requireing manual intervention and configuration.\
**Solution:** Docker make it easy to scale applications horizontally by running multiple container instances allowing for quick and efficient scaling.
### How exactly Docker is used?

### Container/Docker Engine:
Docker Engine is the core component of the Docker platform, responsible for creating, running and managing Docker containers. It serves as the runtime that powers Docker's containization capabilities.\
Here is an in-depth look at the Docker.\

### Components of Docker Engine:
(1) **Docker Daemon(Dockered):**\
->**Funtion:** The Docker Daemon is the background service running on the host machine. It manages Docker objectssuch as images, containers, networks and volumes.\
->**Interaction:** It listens for Docker API requests and processes them, handling containers life cycle operations like start, stop, restart etc.\
(2) **Docker CLI(Docker):**\
->**Function:** The Docker Command Line Interface is the tool that users interact with to communicate with Docker Daemon.\
->**Usage:** Users run Docker Command through the CLI to perform tasks like building images, running containers and managing Docker resources.\
(3) **REST API:**\
->**Funtion:** The Docker REST API allows communication between the Docker CLI and the Docker Daemon. Iy also enables programmatics interaction with teh Docker.\
->**Usage:** Develoopers can use the API to automate Docker operations or integrate Docker functionality into their applications.
